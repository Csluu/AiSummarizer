# Artisummarizer
Artisummarizer is a project that utilizes the power of chatGPT, an advanced language model, to generate accurate and concise summaries of articles. The tool is designed to help users quickly comprehend the main ideas of an article without having to read through the entire text.

With ArtiSummarizer, users can simply input the URL of an article and the tool will automatically generate a summary. The summary is generated based on the key topics, phrases, and ideas present in the article, and is optimized for clarity and brevity.

## Insights and Takeaways
During the development of this project, several insights and takeaways were gained that can be useful for future projects.
- 1 - Redux: I learned about Redux and how it can be used to manage state in a complex application. By using Redux, I was able to keep track of the application's state and easily update it as the user interacted with the interface. This made it easier to manage the different components of the application and ensured that the code remained organized and maintainable.
- 2 - Vite: I also learned about Vite and how it can be used to speed up the development process. Vite is a build tool that allows developers to quickly develop and test their applications by providing a fast development server and hot module reloading. By using Vite, I was able to speed up the development process and iterate quickly on different features of the application.
